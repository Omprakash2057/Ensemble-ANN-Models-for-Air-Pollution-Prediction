# Ensemble ANN Models for Improving Air Pollution Prediction Accuracy

This project implements **Ensemble Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to improve the accuracy of air pollution prediction.  
The model leverages ensemble learning techniques to combine multiple ANN architectures, enhancing robustness and predictive performance.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization of air pollution datasets.
- Implementation of multiple ANN models.
- Ensemble strategy for combining predictions.
- Model evaluation using error metrics and visualizations.
